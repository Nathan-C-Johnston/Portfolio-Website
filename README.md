# Portfolio-Website

This website is challenge assignment #2 for the University of Utah coding certificate program and a portfolio for future professional use. The intention is to setup a website introducing Nathan Johnston (me) and demonstrate coding projects I've completed.

Thanks for checking out my portfolio! If you have work opportunities or professional notes, please feel free to contact me (n.c.johnston@outlook.com)!
