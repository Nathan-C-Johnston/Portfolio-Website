# Portfolio-Website

This website is challenge assignment #2 for the UofU coding certificate program and hopefully future professional use. The intention is to setup a website introducing Nathan Johnston (me) and demostrate coding projects I've completed.

Thanks for checking out my portfolio! If you have work opportunities or professional notes, please feel free to contact me (n.c.johnston@outlook.com)!
